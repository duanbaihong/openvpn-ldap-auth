Important notes:

= User config stored in LDAP
Users configuration can now be stored in LDAP.
the feature is enable by default but can be disabled by running:

./configure --disable-ldapuserconfig

If you use this feature, you ldap server must include ovpn.schema:
in slapd.conf add:
include         /etc/ldap/schema/ovpn.schema

The schema can be found in tests/ovpn.schema.

An OpenVPNAccount can have any attributes from
OpenVPNProfile plus:
OvpnProfile: the DN of a profile where to get default settings
OvpnCCDIfconfigPush: to define a static IP for this user

This allows to provide the same settings for many user belonging
to the same group.

An example LDAP ldif would look like:
dn: uid=user1,ou=thirdparty,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: OpenVPNAccount
uid: user1
cn: user1
userPassword:: dXNlcjE=
sn: user1sn
OvpnProfile: cn=default,ou=profiles,ou=openvpn,dc=example,dc=com
OvpnCCDPushOption: route 192.168.32.0 255.255.255.0
OvpnPFRulesClientDefaultAccept: true
OvpnPFRulesSubnetDefaultAccept: true
OvpnPFRulesSubnet:: KzE5Mi4xNjguMzMuMTkKLTE5Mi4xNjguMzMuMC8yNAorMTkyLjE2OC4zMi
 4wLzI4Ci0xOTIuMTY4LjMyLjAvMjQ=
OvpnEndDate: 20100810100000Z

dn: cn=default,ou=profiles,ou=openvpn,dc=example,dc=com
objectClass: OpenVPNProfile
objectClass: person
cn: default
sn: dummy
OvpnCCDPushReset: TRUE
OvpnCCDPushOption: route 192.168.33.0 255.255.255.0
OvpnCCDPushOption: route 192.168.34.0 255.255.255.0
OvpnStartDate: 20100728000000Z
OvpnEndDate: 20100802100000Z
OvpnPFRulesSubnet:: KzE5Mi4xNjguMzIuMC8yNAotMTkyLjE2OC4zMy4wLzI4CisxOTIuMTY4Lj

OvpnPFRulesClientDefaultAccept: false


default profile allow users to connect from:
28/07/2010 00:00:00 GMT until 02/08/2010 00:00:00 GMT
global push info will be reset
default packet filter rules to clients will drop packets, while it will accept to subnets
The rules for subnets are base64 encoded and is equivalent to:
+192.168.32.0/24
-192.168.33.0/28
+192.168.33.0/24
Also, the routes 192.168.33.0/24 and 192.168.34.0/24 will be pushed.

user1 inherits those settings but override some of them:
It wont be able to connect after 10/08/2010 10:00:00 GTM instead of 02/08/2010 00:00:00 GMT
It will also get 192.168.32.0/24 route pushed to it
Default PF rules are overriden and are instead changed to accept packets to clients
Its PF subnets rules are 
+192.168.33.19
-192.168.33.0/24
+192.168.32.0/28
-192.168.32.0/24

= Multiple profiles

Since 0.0.X, the config syntax has changed a little.
Most importantly, release greater than 0.0.X support multiple profiles
which allow defining different type of openvpn group.

From now on, all information which is not related to LDAP connection details
must be enclosed within 
<profile>
</profile>
tags.

== LDAP server connection details parameters
uri=ldap://192.168.9.135
binddn=cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com
bindpw=secret
version=3
#ssl=start_tls
#tls_reqcert=never
ssl=off
timeout

tls_reqcert can take the following values (default to never): never|try|allow|hard|demand

Some more parameters exist which are ignore at the moment and might be subject
to change, so it is not recommended you use them:
tls_cacertfile
tls_cacertdir
tls_certfile
tls_certkey
tls_ciphersuite

== Profile parameters
Profiles allow to define how to find users. Each profile can have different rules
applied to it.

The following parameters can be defined whithin <profile></profile> tag.
As many profile as you like can be defined.
The first one that can match a user will be used.

Here are the parameters you can use:
usersdn
search_filter
search_scope
groupdn
group_search_filter
member_attribute
redirect_gateway_prefix
redirect_gateway_flags
enable_pf
default_pf_rules

If the plugin was compiled with ldapuserconfig support, you can also use:
default_profiledn

An example config file can be found in tests/config.conf


= group_search_filter syntax change

In 0.0.X releases, group_search_filter syntax was not needing parentheses
and was looking like:
group_search_filter=|(cn=vpn)(cn=sysadmins)

Since 0.1.X the syntax has changed to be consistant with search_filter and
MUST now be within parentheses.
As such, the previous filter need to be changed to:
group_search_filter=(|(cn=vpn)(cn=sysadmins))
